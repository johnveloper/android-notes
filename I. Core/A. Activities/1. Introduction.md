# Introduction to Activities

The `Activity` class is a crucial component of Android app, and the way activities are launched and put together is a fundamental part of the platform's application model.

Unlike programming paradigms in which apps are launched with a `main()` method, the Android system initiates code in an `Activity` instance by invoking specific callback methods that correspond to specific stages of its lifecycle.

This lesson introduces the concept of activities, and then provides some lightweight guidance about how to work with them. For additional information about best practices in architecting your app, see [Guide to App Architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/guide.html).

// MindMapping would be better.
// I should use the full power of your mind, imagination to learn faster and understand deeper, for longer.
// I will create mind maps and be more flexible in my studying instead of basically rewriting the docs.
// If I decide to use digital mind maps, I'll place them here.
